# Deskripsi project
  This project aims to predict house prices using a machine learning model, looking at the influence of each variable on       house prices.

# Model machine learning
  In this project, 4 machine learning models are used, namely
    1. Ridge regression
    Ridge Regression, also known as L2 Regularization, is a regression technique used to prevent overfitting by adding a         penalty to the magnitude of the regression coefficients.

    2. Lasso regression
    Lasso Regression, or L1 Regularization, is a regression technique similar to Ridge Regression but uses an L1 penalty for     regularization.

    3. XGBoost regression
    XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) is a highly efficient and optimized implementation of the gradient boosting              algorithm used for various regression and classification tasks.

    4. LightGBM regression
    LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine) is a gradient boosting framework optimized for high efficiency and                scalability.

# Conclusion
    1. The Ridge, Lasso, XGBoost, and LightGBM models all have very similar performance in terms of R² and RMSE. All models      have almost the same R².

    2. Although the R² values ​​are similar, the Lasso model has a slightly lower RMSE than the other models. This shows that      the Lasso model has a slightly smaller average prediction error rate.

    3. The Lasso model is the best choice based on performance evaluation using R² and RMSE metrics on available test data.
