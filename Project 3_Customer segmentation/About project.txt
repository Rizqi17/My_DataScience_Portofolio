# Project description
This project aims to analyze customer data from a mall and cluster it into several segmentations and find insights into each mall customer segmentation.

# Machine learning model
The machine learning model used in this project is
1. KMeans clustering
K-Means is an unsupervised learning algorithm used to divide a dataset into a number of clusters
𝑘 which has been determined. Each cluster consists of data points that have similar characteristics to each other.

2. Hierarchical clustering
Hierarchical Clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm that builds a hierarchy of clusters. There are two main approaches: Agglomerative (bottom-up) and Divisional (top-down).
